I developed and designed a website prototype for an online luxury watches collection called WatcHGoods. This project showcased my proficiency in both UI/UX design and web development. 

First, I utilized Figma to create wireframes and interactive prototypes, focusing on intuitive navigation and responsive layouts. As the website will showcase collections of luxury watches, I aimed for a design that is more high-end and sophisticated, yet still providing seamless and intuitive user experience.

Then, I employed HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for form validations. I also incorporated mobile responsiveness within the CSS to ensure user experience across all types of devices. Lastly, I deployed the website on Vercel to make it accessible to public.
